        <section class="post-content">
            <p>So, I decided to start my own blog to write posts about the libraries or applications that I publish and there is no better place for a blog to be hosted than <strong>Github</strong> using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GithubPages</a>. After creating the repo and posting a <em>Hello World</em> index page, it was time for finding the tool (or framwork) that can facilitate the work of posting to this "blog". </p>

<p>All I wanted was a simple, minimalistic, but yet well styled blog that has a decent content management system so that posting take just a few minutes worth of my time (especially since I have no web UI/UX experience). In my search for such a platform I came across <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>, it sounded promising in many ways. It was simple to config and modify (Ruby and Yamel), has a huge community behind it (&gt;22k starts on Github). But, for me writing MarkDown in text is not easy when I don't see the result in realtime (or at least a click away), I even write and edit my repo README markups on Github so I can have the preview option right there. And the downside of Jekyll is that it was not user-friendly enough for my purpose, I didn't mind having limited configuration options but easier way to manage the content and write posts (not having to follow the dating format on file names and headers and etc).</p>

<p>I started searching for MarkDown editors and found <a href="https://github.com/timsayshey/Ghost-Markdown-Editor">Ghost MarkDown Editor</a>. I fell in love on the first sight but after some digging I noticed <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> itself is a blogging framework with whole content management and ton of features. It is pretty popular as well (lots of themes for it). It all sounded great but I was not sure if I can host it on Github pages because it is not a static blog. But I liked it so much that I was willing to find a way to make it work. It turns out that I was not the only one who wanted to host Ghost's blog on GithubPages and there is even a nice tool to generate a static blog out of your locally hosted Ghost blog and its called <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">Buster</a> yet another open-source and awesome tool.</p>

<p>Ghost's content management console, its realtime preview for MarkDown, it's simplicity, and ease of use sold it to me. </p>

<p><a href="http://ledtechnica.com/free-ghost-hosting-on-github-pages/">Here</a> is a post from <em>LED Technica</em> which has steps for setting up ghost and pushing it to GithubPages.</p>
